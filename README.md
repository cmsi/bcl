BCL: Balance Condition Library
================================

The goal of the BCL is providing
- C++ reference implementation of the rejection-optimized irreversible kernel (ST2010) and its reversible version (ST2013) as well as Metropolis-Hasting and Gibbs sampler in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
- interface for C, Fortran, Python, etc, and
- example and benchmark programs of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation based on several MCMC kernels on standard models (Ising, Potts, etc) in the field of statistical physics.
